This package enables Pimcore to write to an Azure Storage Account via Flysystem. It acts as a wrapper around https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem-azure-blob-storage. To install:

1. Run `composer require torq/pimcore-flysystem-azure-bundle`
2. Set environment variables and values for `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`, `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONTAINER`, `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONTAINER_ASSETS` and `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY` which will allow the bundle to write to your Storage Account.
3. Register the bundle by adding it to your `Kernel.php`:
    ```php
    class Kernel extends PimcoreKernel
    {
        public function registerBundlesToCollection(BundleCollection $collection) {
            $collection->addBundle(new \Torq\PimcoreFlysystemAzureBundle\TorqPimcoreFlysystemAzureBundle);
        }
    }
4. Add the contents of the file `flysystem_example.yaml` to your project's `flysystem.yaml` file (typically located at `pimcore-root/config/packages/flysystem.yaml`).
